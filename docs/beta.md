If you cannot wait to try the new version, you have two options of getting started earlier: 

**Option 1** You can sign up for a free trial of Coderr Live which already contains everything we are planning to have for the open source version, Coderr Community Server. As described on the webpage, the new Coderr Live also adds two important functions; the ability set prioritization and tracking application release performance relative to errors generated. These features will not go into the open source release.

**Option 2** You can sign up for the Beta 2.0 Program that starts now and means you will get a chance to give feedback and ask questions about Coderr as you run it. All you need to do is send us an email and then we will provide you the downloadable files, with instructions. We will also periodically post further instructions and things we want you to try, at our Beta site, where we encourage you to provide feedback and ask questions.
