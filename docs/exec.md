Executive summary
==================

Can you answer the following questions:

* How many bugs are there in each version of your application that your users are currently running?
* How many users are affected by those bugs? 

If you can't answer those questions, try asking your lead developer. Still a no go?

There are a lot of standardized way to measure code quality and technical debt. They are however an indication and not a gurantee that you won't have bugs in the applications that you release. 

codeRR give you hard facts. Once the system is installed you have facts about how your applicaion ***really*** is perfoming. You get an always up-to-date picture about the number of errors, the number of affected users of each error and even a heat map of the world to quickly identify where the bug happened.

In short, codeRR helps you stop making business decisions based on assumptions. The service allows you to prioritize bugs that have been proved to be critical.
