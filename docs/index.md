Coderr Documentation
======================

Welcome to the Coderr documentation.

Coderr requires both that you install one or more of our nuget packages and that you use one of our server versions.

* [Coderr Community Server](https://github.com/coderrio/coderr.server) - Open Source, AGPL license.
* [Coderr Live](https://lobby.coderr.io) - Our hosted service (free up to 500 error reports / month).
* [Coderr Premise](https://coderr.io/features/premise) - Locally installed server with a complete feature set (including enterprise features).


## Quick start


Install or use one of our servers above.

Once installed, you need to configure one of our nuget packeges.
The packages are [listed here](./client/libraries/). Choose one and install it using nuget.

To configure Coderr you need to get an `appKey` and a `sharedSecret` from the server. Use a browser and visit your Coderr Server.
One application have been created by default.
